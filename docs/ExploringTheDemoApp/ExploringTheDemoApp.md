# Guide - Exploring the Demo App

This guide covers your first look and can be used even before installing software.  


The text provides a one line overview of about twenty of the main 
modules of hundreds shown during installation.   The selection 
and configuration of all these modules is the value of using a kit.   When you run across
a module you have never heard of and want to get a quick overview, the fastest way is
to google for 'slideshare theModuleName' and skim someone's presentation.

The page is rendered from HTML including React components coded as custom HTML tags.
The components use properties to alter appearance and sets of data.  Notice some of the components on the page:

# The Take Away

Looking through each page of the DemoApp will lead you to more questions which will keep you 
searching and learning and you will slowly master this technology.

Here are some additional quests you could undertake:

* How do the About page MiniBar and the status bar share data about the time last loaded?
* How would you add a fourth counter that incremented by two?   How many files would you need
  to touch?
* What order are calls made when you click "Reload Widgets" on the widgets page?
* Why does surveyValidation use memoize?

Install, hack, explore!
